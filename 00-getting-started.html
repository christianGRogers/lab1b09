<h1>B09 Lab week 2</h1>

<p>It can be quite overwhelming to use a Unix-like computing environment
(especially the text-mode command prompt) for the first time.  This lab may help
you start.

<p>We begin with some tips for beginners.  If you are already familiar with
Linux, you may skip right to section <a href="#ex">The Exercises</a> (but
download and save the starter files first).

<!--
<h2>File management</h2>

<p>Please take a look ahead at the lecture slides “file management” for week
2 for a quick tour of file management commands at the shell.
-->

<h2>Viewers and Editors</h2>

<p>To view a short text file: ‘<code>cat <var>filename</var></code>’

<p>To view a long text file: ‘<code>less <var>filename</var></code>’.
Here are some of its keyboard commands:

<table>
<tr><th>action <th>key
<tr><td>quit <td>q
<tr><td>scroll <td>Down, Up, PgDn, PgUp
</table>

<p>Simple editor in a terminal: ‘<code>nano <var>filename</var></code>’.  It
lists some commands at the bottom, using ^ to mean the Ctrl key, e.g., ^X
means Ctrl-X and is how to exit.

<p>Simple GUI editor on Ubuntu Desktop: ‘<code>gedit <var>filename</var></code>’.
You can also launch it by: Press the Windows key, enter “gedit”, then click the
obvious icon.

<p>In the long term, you should invest time in learning a sophisticated editor
geared towards programming. Popular choices: VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Spacemacs,
Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++.


<h2>Survival Tips</h2>

<p>Ctrl-C can abort most commands in terminals.  Great for accidental wrong
commands that hang and you need your command prompt back.

<p>Most commands recognize the ‘--help’ argument and output a summary of how to
use them, e.g., ‘<code>ls --help</code>’.

<p>Most also have longer docs under the ‘<code>man</code>’ command (short for
“manual”), e.g., ‘<code>man ls</code>’.  The UI is similar to that of
‘<code>less</code>’.

<p>Exercise: The “summary” from ‘<code>ls --help</code>’ is pretty long.  Can
you add ‘<code>less</code>’ and pipelining to display it one screenful at a
time?  Additional information you need: ‘<code>less</code>’ is happy to read
from stdin if you don't provide a filename.


<h2 id="ex">The Exercises</h2>

<p>(Starter files are also available on mathlab in directory
/courses/courses/cscb09s24/laialber/l02 )

<p>These exercises introduce some Unix text-processing utilities and train you
to pick out specific information from Unix-style documentation.

<p>Each exercise tells you the program name to use and where to find its
documentation.  Your job is to find out from the documentation how to craft the
arguments to achieve what the exercise requires.  The textbook The Linux Command
Line also helps.  The first exercise is solved with explanation.

<p>Each exercise specifies where to input from and output to, which can be
files, and/or standard input (stdin), and/or standard output (stdout).  As
discussed in lecture, you do not always know that stdin and stdout mean the
terminal, and it should not matter, and you already know how to test your
solution against both terminal and file redirection.

<p>(But reminders: When stdin is terminal and you enter input by hand, use
Ctrl-D on its own line to signify end of input.  File redirection for stdin uses
the notation “<code>&lt; filename</code>”.  File redirection for stdout uses the
notation “<code>&gt; filename</code>”.)

<p>This lab can take longer time than the tutorial session; don't feel bad if
you have to continue after class.  This is an exception.


<h3>0. ls</h3>

<p>Use <code>ls</code> to list the non-dot names in the current directory, in
order from oldest to newest.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>ls --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man ls</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/ls-invocation.html"
>link</a>.

<p><b>How I solved it</b>: In any of those docs, I noticed:

<p>“Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
<br>List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).”

<p>That's perfect, I can get the current directory by doing nothing for the FILE
part.

<p>Now the options.  I noticed:

<table class="tab">
<col class="option"/> <col/>
<tr><td>-a, --all           <td>do not ignore entries starting with .
</table>

<p>I do want to ignore dot files, so I should absolutely avoid that option.

<p>Then I noticed:

<table class="tab">
<col class="option"/> <col/>
<tr><td>-t <td>sort by time, newest first
</table>

<p>and I also noticed:

<table class="tab">
<col class="option"/> <col/>
<tr><td>-r, --reverse <td>reverse order while sorting
</table>

<p>So if I use them both, I'll get oldest to newest.

<p><b>My solution</b>: <code>ls -t -r</code>


<h3>1. Dealing with a naughty filename</h3>

<p>I have a file but it has a naughty filename: “--help”.  Use <code>mv</code>
to rename it to “help.txt”.

<p>Documentation: In this case the most important hint is somewhere in the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Common-options.html"
>Common Options</a> section.



<h3>2. cat</h3>

<p>Use <code>cat</code> to send the concatenation of these inputs to standard
output: the file cat-in-1.txt, then standard input, then the file cat-in-2.txt,
in that order.  (Verbatim, so for example don't add line numbers, don't display
$ at end of each line, etc.)

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>cat --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man cat</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cat-invocation.html"
>link</a>.


<h3>3. head</h3>

<p>Use <code>head</code> to output everything except the last line of a file
named headtail-in.txt. Output to standard output.

<p>A sample input file is provided, but it is only an example. Your solution
must work even if I change the content.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>head --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man head</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/head-invocation.html"
>link</a>.


<h3>4. tail</h3>

<p>Use <code>tail</code> to output the last line of the file headtail-in.txt.
Output to standard output.

<p>A sample input file is provided, but it is only an example. Your solution
must work even if I change the content.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>tail --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man tail</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/tail-invocation.html"
>link</a>.


<h3>5. wc</h3>

<p>Use <code>wc</code> to output the number of lines in the file
headtail-in.txt.  Output to standard output.  Don't output other counts, e.g.,
don't output the number of words.

<p>A sample input file is provided, but it is only an example. Your solution
must work even if I change the content.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>wc --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man wc</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/wc-invocation.html"
>link</a>.


<h3>6. tr</h3>

<p>Use <code>tr</code> just once to perform ROT13 decryption
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">Wikipedia entry</a>). Input from
a file named rot13.txt; output to a file named spoiler.txt. Don't forget that
English letters include both uppercase and lowercase.

<p>A sample input file is provided, but it is only an example. Your solution
must work even if I change the content.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>tr --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man tr</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/tr-invocation.html"
>link</a>.

<p>ROT13 is great for posting spoilers without spoiling. The sample input
encrypts a spoiler to the 2008 Iron Man movie.

<p>(Food for thought, no need to hand in: Why does the same command do
encryption too?)


<h3>7. tr but for deletion</h3>

<p>Use <code>tr</code> just once to delete all occurences of the characters ‘2’
and ‘u’ from the input.  Input from standard input; output to standard output.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>tr --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man tr</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/tr-invocation.html"
>link</a>.


<h3>8. tee</h3>

<p>Use <code>tee</code> to copy standard input to 3 destinations: standard
output, file tee-out.txt, file tee-acc.txt. Overwrite tee-out.txt, but append to
tee-acc.txt.

<p>Hint: Use <code>tee</code> twice, connected with a pipeline.

<p>This exercise is about <code>tee</code> and pipelining. Other approaches will
not be accepted.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>tee --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man tee</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/tee-invocation.html"
>link</a>.

<p>Trivia: This program is called “tee” because: Think of T-shaped pipes in
plumbing, and “T” is pronounced as “tee”.


<h3>9. yes</h3>

<p>Use a pipeline consisting of <code>yes</code> and <code>head</code> to output
exactly 42 lines of “nonono” to standard output.

<p>You must use a pipeline (the “<code>|</code>” thing as seen in the lecture),
not the “<code>&lt;(yes ...)</code>” feature you might find on the Internet.
This exercise requires pipelining.

<p><code>yes</code> documentation: ‘<code>yes --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man
yes</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/yes-invocation.html"
>link</a>.

<p><code>head</code> documentation: ‘<code>head --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man
head</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/head-invocation.html"
>link</a>.


<h3>10. comm</h3>

<p>Use <code>comm</code> to output lines that appear in menu-new.txt but not
in menu-old.txt.  We assume that the two input files are already sorted.

<p>Sample input files are provided, but they are only an example. Your solution
must work even if I change the content.

<p>Documentation: ‘<code>comm --help</code>’ or ‘<code>man comm</code>’ or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/comm-invocation.html"
>link</a>.


<h3>What to Submit</h3>

<p>Please submit a single file utils.txt on MarkUs.  The starter files include a
copy that exemplifies the expected format, with blanks for you to fill in your
solution.

<p>Format: Each line begins with an exercise number (e.g., 0 for the ls
exercise, 2 for the cat exercise) (optionally surrounded by spaces), then a
colon (optionally surrounded by spaces), then your solution to that exercise
(leave it blank if you can't solve it).  For every exercise there is exactly one
line.  The lines should be in increasing order of exercise numbers.  Please
don't include multiple solutions.

<p>This lab may be automarked or marked by humans.
